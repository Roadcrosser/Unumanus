<b>Haaaalp, the script doesn't work this is all your fauuult! Fix iiit! AAAH!</b>
</div>
<b><p style="font-size:18">Here are some issues that might arise regarding the script:</p></b>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>I can't write in HTML without the script kicking in!<br>I want to turn the script off!</b>
<br>
<br>
Use Ctrl+Alt+A to toggle the script on and off, temporarily disabling it when needed.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>The script doesn't work!<br>The script won't start or anything!<br>I get an error!</b>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Make sure AutoHotkey is installed and is in the latest version. v1.1.23.01 should be fine.</li>
<li>Make sure you followed the instructions and named the script "AutoHotkey.ahk"</li>
<li>Make sure the file is placed in the Documents folder.</li>
<li>Make sure no other AutoHotkey script is running.</li>
<li>Make sure your Computer language is set to "English".</li>
</ul>
<br>
If all the above is true, <a href="https://github.com/Roadcrosser/roadcrosser.github.io/issues/new">make an issue on my GitHub</a> and describe your problem in detail.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>AutoHotkey isn't supported for my OS!</b>
<br>
<br>
Use Windows, nerd.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>There are too many features here! I want to get rid of some!<br>I am a person who doesn't like jokes!</b>
<br>
<br>
A config file is generated in the Documents folder. You can use this to toggle some of the features off.
<br>
If you don't like the jokey stuff, dial down your FUN to 0 because you are a very boring person.
